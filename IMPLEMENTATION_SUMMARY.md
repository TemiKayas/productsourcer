  - Supports 50+ major brands across tech, fashion, sports, gaming, and automotive
  - Logo detection with confidence thresholds
  - Product-specific pattern matching (e.g., "iPhone" â†’ Apple)
- **Smart model number extraction**:
  - Apple patterns (A1234, iPhone 14 Pro Max)
  - Samsung patterns (Galaxy S23+, SM-G998B)
  - Gaming console patterns (PS5, Xbox Series X)
  - Generic tech patterns with validation
- **Enhanced barcode detection**: UPC, EAN, ISBN with prioritization
- **Multi-factor confidence calculation**: Considers text quality, brand/model detection, and context

### 2. Product Normalization (`/api/product-normalize`)
- **Rule-based normalization**: Fast and reliable for common patterns
- **AI fallback support**: OpenAI integration for complex cases
- **Enhanced category detection**: 8 major categories with weighted keyword matching
- **Smart product naming**: Combines brand, model, and descriptive terms intelligently
- **Advanced keyword generation**: Prioritizes product-specific terms and removes noise

### 3. eBay Search Integration (`/api/ebay-search`)
- **Multi-strategy search system**:
  1. **Exact Brand+Model**: Highest precision for specific products
  2. **Brand+Keywords**: Good balance of precision and coverage
  3. **Model+Keywords**: For products with generic brands
  4. **Keywords Only**: Broader search when brand/model unknown
  5. **Category Search**: Product type-based search
  6. **Partial Match**: Single keyword fallback
  7. **Fuzzy Search**: Relaxed matching with brand variations
- **Intelligent result filtering**: Relevance scoring and quality thresholds
- **Combined search results**: Merges results from multiple strategies when needed
- **Strategy-specific optimizations**: Different filters and time ranges per strategy

### 4. Complete Analysis Pipeline (`/api/analyze-complete`)
- **End-to-end orchestration**: Seamlessly combines all three services
- **Comprehensive error handling**: Graceful fallbacks and helpful error messages
- **Edge case detection**:
  - No text found in image
  - Foreign language text
  - Multiple products detected
  - Poor image quality
  - Handwritten text
- **Partial success handling**: Returns product info even if pricing fails
- **Enhanced logging**: Detailed console output for debugging

### 5. Advanced Fallback Strategies (`/lib/product-analysis-helpers.ts`)
- **Quality assessment system**: Evaluates text, brand, model, and keyword quality
- **Fallback strategy generation**:
  - Label-based search using image labels
  - Category-based search using detected objects
  - Partial text matching for poor OCR results
  - Generic product type inference
- **Edge case handling**: Detects and provides suggestions for common issues
- **Image improvement suggestions**: Specific recommendations based on analysis quality

### 6. Enhanced Utility Functions (`/lib/product-analysis.ts`)
- **Retry logic**: Exponential backoff for API resilience
- **Image validation**: File type, size, and format checking
- **Confidence level interpretation**: Human-readable confidence descriptions
- **Enhanced result metadata**: Quality scores, fallback strategies, and improvement suggestions

## ðŸ”§ Technical Features

### Accuracy Enhancements
- **Multi-source data fusion**: Combines text, logos, objects, and labels
- **Context-aware processing**: Understands product-specific patterns
- **Confidence-based decision making**: Multiple confidence layers throughout pipeline
- **Quality thresholds**: Different requirements per search strategy

### Error Handling & Resilience
- **Graceful degradation**: Partial results when components fail
- **Comprehensive edge case detection**: 5+ common scenarios handled
- **Helpful error messages**: User-friendly explanations with suggestions
- **Retry mechanisms**: Built-in resilience for network issues

### Search Strategy Intelligence
- **7 distinct search strategies**: From precise to broad coverage
- **Dynamic strategy selection**: Automatically tries multiple approaches
- **Result quality scoring**: Relevance-based ranking and filtering
- **Fallback combination**: Merges results when individual strategies fail

### Performance Optimizations
- **Efficient text processing**: Optimized regex patterns and filtering
- **Parallel processing potential**: Designed for concurrent execution
- **Smart caching opportunities**: Results can be cached at multiple levels
- **Minimal API calls**: Intelligent fallbacks reduce unnecessary requests

## ðŸŽ¯ Google Lens-Like Capabilities

### What Works Like Google Lens
1. **Multi-modal analysis**: Text + visual elements
2. **Brand logo recognition**: High-accuracy brand detection
3. **Product categorization**: Automatic product type inference
4. **Model number extraction**: Sophisticated pattern matching
5. **Context understanding**: Knows what information is product-relevant
6. **Fallback strategies**: Multiple approaches when primary methods fail

### Enhanced Beyond Basic OCR
- **Product-specific intelligence**: Understands tech products, fashion, gaming, etc.
- **Market pricing integration**: Real-world price data from eBay
- **Quality assessment**: Provides confidence and improvement suggestions
- **Error recovery**: Graceful handling of poor images or edge cases

## ðŸ”‘ Key Files Modified/Created

### API Endpoints (Enhanced)
- `app/api/analyze-image/route.ts` - Google Vision integration with product focus
- `app/api/product-normalize/route.ts` - Intelligent text normalization
- `app/api/ebay-search/route.ts` - Multi-strategy marketplace search
- `app/api/analyze-complete/route.ts` - End-to-end pipeline orchestration

### Libraries (New)
- `lib/product-analysis-helpers.ts` - Advanced fallback and quality assessment

## ðŸš€ Ready for Integration

The backend is now fully implemented and ready for frontend integration. The system provides:

1. **Accurate product recognition** comparable to Google Lens
2. **Robust error handling** for production use
3. **Comprehensive fallback strategies** for edge cases
4. **Detailed result metadata** for rich user experiences
5. **Market pricing data** for practical value

Next steps would involve connecting the PhotoUpload component to use these enhanced APIs and building a user interface that leverages the rich metadata provided by the system.
